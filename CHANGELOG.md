## 1.5.0 / 2020-11-12

* [CHANGE] Add the default preset 'extra_small_user' and reference it in the CLI flags. This will raise the limits of the 'small_user' preset to the defaults for `ingester.max-samples-per-query` and `ingester.max-series-per-query`. #200
* [CHANGE] Removed the config option `$._config.ingester.statefulset_replicas` which was used only when running Cortex chunks storage with WAL enabled. To configure the number of ingester replicas you should now use the following: #210
  ```
  ingester_statefulset+:
      statefulSet.mixin.spec.withReplicas(6),
  ```
* [CHANGE] The compactor statefulset is now configured with the `Parallel` pod management policy, in order to scale up quickly. #214
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add the Ruler to the read resources dashboard #205
* [ENHANCEMENT] Read dashboards now use `cortex_querier_request_duration_seconds` metrics to allow for accurate dashboards when deploying Cortex as a single-binary. #199
* [ENHANCEMENT] Improved Ruler dashboard. Includes information about notifications, reads/writes, and per user per rule group evaluation. #197, #205
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add new `CortexCompactorRunFailed` alert when compactor run fails. #206
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add `flusher-job-blocks.libsonnet` with support for flushing blocks disks. #187
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add more alerts on failure conditions for ingesters when running the blocks storage. #208
* [FEATURE] Latency recording rules for the metric`cortex_querier_request_duration_seconds` are now part of a `cortex_querier_api` rule group. #199
* [FEATURE] Add overrides-exporter as optional deployment to expose configured runtime overrides and presets. #198
* [FEATURE] Add a dashboard for the alertmanager. #207
* [BUGFIX] Added `ingester-blocks` to ingester's job label matcher, in order to correctly get metrics when migrating a Cortex cluster from chunks to blocks. #203

## 1.4.0 / 2020-10-02

* [CHANGE] Lower the default overrides configs for ingestion and create a new overrides user out of the previous config #183
* [CHANGE] The project is now licensed with Apache-2.0 license. #169
* [CHANGE] Add overrides config to tsdb store-gateway. #167
* [CHANGE] Ingesters now default to running as `StatefulSet` with WAL enabled. It is controlled by the config `$._config.ingester_deployment_without_wal` which is `false` by default. Setting the config to `true` will yield the old behaviour (stateless `Deployment` without WAL enabled). #72
* [CHANGE] We now allow queries that are 32 days long. For example, rate(metric[32d]). Before it was 31d. #173
* [CHANGE] Renamed `container_name` and `pod_name` label names to `container` and `pod` respectively. This is required in order to comply with cAdvisor metrics changes shipped with Kubernetes 1.16. #179
* [CHANGE] Removed the `experimental` prefix from blocks storage CLI flags. #179
* [CHANGE] Rename flags `store-gateway.replication-factor` and `store-gateway.tokens-file-path` to `store-gateway.sharding-ring.replication-factor` and `store-gateway.sharding-ring.tokens-file-path` in anticipation of v1.4 release. #191
* [ENHANCEMENT] Enable support for HA in the Cortex Alertmanager #147
* [ENHANCEMENT] Support `alertmanager.fallback_config` option in the Alertmanager. #179
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add support for S3 block storage. #181
* [ENHANCEMENT] Add support for Azure block storage. #182 #190
* [BUGFIX] Add support the `local` ruler client type  #175
* [BUGFIX] Fixes `ruler.storage.s3.url` argument for the Ruler. It used an incorrect argument. #177
