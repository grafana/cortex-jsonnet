# Changelog

## master / unreleased

* [CHANGE] The project is now licensed with Apache-2.0 license. #169
* [CHANGE] Add overrides config to tsdb store-gateway. #167
* [CHANGE] Ingesters now default to running as `StatefulSet` with WAL enabled. It is controlled by the config `$._config.ingester_deployment_without_wal` which is `false` by default. Setting the config to `true` will yeild the old behaviour (stateless `Deployment` without WAL enabled). #72
* [CHANGE] We now allow queries that are 32 days long. For example, rate(metric[32d]). Before it was 31d. #173
